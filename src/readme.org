* Dependencies
To compile the project, you will need =rustc= or preferrably =cargo=.

The backend works by taking the json and turning it into the =dot= format. To get an svg, you will need to have =graphviz= installed.

* Running

#+begin_src
cargo run name_of_json_file.json name_of_output_file.svg
#+end_src


As an example, there are files [[file:~/RRG-JSON/test1.json][test1]]  and [[file:~/RRG-JSON/test2.json][test2]]  for example json files.
